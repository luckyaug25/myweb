		I am starting an very erotic tale “ Entrapment of a Housewife ,Swati”. As this would be a long story , this would have a build up and please bear it with me and this is going to be very sexy ride. Enjoy the story and please give your feedback , good or bad , both are equally welcome.<br />
<br />
Rrinnggg ring .. the door bell rings and S was in the kitchen , rushed to open the door .<br />
Sorry Swati , I am late , as had a meeting late into the meeting and Mr. Mehra  wont let me leave on time as usual .<br />
“Whats so new in that? “ Swati mutters irritatedly , its me who has to keep waiting and waiting , nagged Swati. <br />
Sorry Swati , let me make it up, saying Vinod pulled his sexy wife to him and  accept my apologies and held her face in his palms and brought his lips close to her face and stuck his lips to hers and gave her a long smooch. She smooched him back viciously for couple of minutes and then wriggled out and said Jaan , “ this wont do , you always do this when I am angry as you know this always work. “ Saying that she stormed back to her kitchen . <br />
Swati and Vinod were married barely a year ago , they were in the same college in Mumbai , he was her senior in college , they dated for 4 years  before they got married a year before.  So Vinod  was now 30 years and she was 27 . Both had completed  their respective MBAs and she started working in a IT company in Mumbai till marriage . Vinod joined a Multinational Company in Pune and was working in the dealer sales for the company in Pune . When they got married , Swati left her job in Mumbai and joined VN in Pune and was not really interested in working and was more interested in having a sweet home in her own dream world, which she was enjoying in Pune. She loved the free carefree life , going to movies , clubs , discos , having great food and most importantly having lots of hot sex . In a nut shell she was very happy here in Pune as she was getting all of these in Pune.<br />
Swati was a very beautiful , very sexy and sensuous woman . She had the perfect Indian body and she was trained in bharatnatyam and kathak dancer as her hobby since her college days and used to dance for cultural functions , get together and used to practice her dance regularly.. She was 5 ft 3 inches in height, slightly dusky with beautiful  large and expressive eyes, long silky hair almost to her waist , a perfect nose and a perfect oval face , with full pouting lips inviting to be savoured and devoured . She was not the slim types was filled in all the right places.  She looked eerily very similar to  Mallu Film Actress Parvathi Menon  with the same skin colour and the body type. She was blessed with  large breasts which stood out proudly defying gravity and staring at the world . Her stomach was flat with a deep navel  and her hips flared out very wide giving her the perfect hourglass figure. But crowning glory was her ass. It was simply magnificent , it was bigggg  but very shapely . fleshy but firm , it really protruded out and no clothing of her could hide the size of the assets. Her thighs were thick and  fleshy but firm and her calves were strong too. In effect she was an absolute mouth watering treat .<br />
<br />

<br />
In their apartment building in  Pune , she was the cynosure of all eyes , right from the neighbors to the watchmen all ogled her big breasts and swaying ass , some slyly and some brazenly but all wantonly.<br />
“ Swats , there is good news and bad news “ proclaimed VN as SW started moing towards kitchen to arrange for tea for Vinod. “ which one you would like to hear first? “ continued Vinod . “ Hmm tell the good one first “ replied SW from the kitchen. “ Well then, I got a promotion …I have promoted as Branch Head ” declared Vinod . “ WOW that’s wonderful news , cried Sw aloud genuinely happy and rushed to hug Vinod and said “ Congratulations my love ,you totally deserved it , I know my hubby is one smart man” . She then paused and looked up and asked pensively and worried as if it might dent her happiness“ Now tell what is the not so good news ? <br />
Vinod took a deep breath and said “ Well , this promotion comes with a transfer .. I have been asked to go to Kolhapur and set up our company’s branch . This came as a big brick falling over her head , she was aghast and crest fallen .” No how is it possible ? You were doing so well here . Why you  ? She protested. She loved the life here in Pune as mentioned earlier Pune offered her all she required , modern life , freedom  etc etc . “ Sweetie Pie , Our company’s sales are  picking up in southern Maharashtra but its really erratic and as we don’t have an office there and Mr. Mehra feels that our distributer there is manipulating our sales in connivance with our competition and for that we need to have an Branch office there as he trusts  me to take control of the situation and set it right. <br />
“ But its so unfair …..”  Cried out Swati ,” I cant even think of leaving Pune to go to that backward place , my life would be so screwed. And so boring.. No Vinod , please request Mr. Mehra to appoint someone else , please ..” <br />
“No Swats, I cant do that as I would lose my promotion and that guy Swapnil ( Vinod’ rival at work at the same grade)was so jealous and would  jump on this opportunity and do you want that Mitali (Swapnil’s Wife) to throw that superior attitude to you due to her husband’s promotion ( Swati and Mitali never got along with each other and always were taunting each other whenever they met for office or social functions)”.<br />
That stumped Swati a bit , but she was not at all happy with this transfer . “ Shall I talk to Mr. Mehra and request him to give you a posting as branch manager in Pune or better transfer to any branch in Mumbai “ She desperately said as she had a good relation with Mr, Mehra . <br />
“ No Swats that wont work , they gave me a out of the turn promotion only to take charge of ths challenging task, other wise my promotion would have taken 2-3 years , justified Vinod and added “ in another 2 to 3 years I could be the regional manager and if lucky in Pune itself taking the place of Mr. Mehra as he is trying hard to move to his home city Chandigarh  and …. “ Continued Vinod with a wink  “ at that time Swapnil would be reporting to me and then you could have an edge over Mitali. “ Mmmm  yesss   would love to see the face of the wild cat Mitali .<br />
Vinod was relieved as he knew that Sw would resist immensely when told about the transfer and convincing her would be very difficult , but with the ‘Mitali’ card he knew that he has managed to partly do that , rest he would do slowly but surely. <br />
“So when we have to go ? asked Swati in a resigned tone . <br />
“ I ll go there  tomorrow and do a visit , appraise of the situation and have lots of ground work to do . I am expected to establish the office and start the office by 1st of next month hence before that we have to hand over this house back to company by the month end so as to take house there in Kolhapur. <br />
“ Vinu , I want a nice house there in Kolhapur as I am compromising so much to go there”  said Swati.<br />
“O Sweetie Pie , Shall get you a rajwada ( Royal Bunglow as they say in Marathi )  laughed Vinod.
	</div>
    <div class="post_body scaleimages" id="pid_4889854">
		Next day evening , Vinod got ready and his office driver came to drop him to the railway station for the train to Kolhapur ( he had decided against taking his car as the drive would have exhausted him) and started off his journey  . Little did he know this was the beginning of  a life changing journey for both him and his sweet wife Swati. <br />
During the journey , he was recollecting the information given by Mr. Mehra  , about the challenges he would be facing . He was told that their principle distributer M.Majid Khan was a very powerful businessman who had lots of connection and influence in the political circles and had sponsored the ruling political party in many of their activities . Mehra had also told him though this guy is creating disturbances in hand with our competitors , he still remains indispensible as his influence is almost total in our line of business and we should always have him on our side and wean him towards us away from the competition until we find a better distributer .So Vinod realized he had a real challenge on his hands.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
He reached Kolhapur  station early morning and he was received at the station by a man in his thirties apparently , a dark man around  5ft 9inch ,  athletic with lean muscles with a bit unruly hair , sharp features , deep eyes, wear a white pathan suit . He approached Vinod and said in a deep voice “Salam , aap Vinod hai ? “ He was holding a photo of Vinod ( sent to him by his office for identification ). <br />
“ Ha Main Vinod “ replied Vinod <br />
“ Main Abdul , Majid bhai ne bheja hai aap ko receive karne keliye , aap safar toh sab theek tha na? (I am Abdul , Mr. Majid Bhai had sent me to receive you ,hope your journey was good)”.<br />
“ Hi Abdul, “    Shaking hands , responded Vinod. “  Safar bahut acha tha ( Journey was very good.” ).<br />
Abdul took Vinod’s baggage and escorted Vinod to a waiting SUV car and they reached the hotel , wherin Vinod checked in and Abdul told him “Sir, Aap fresh hoyiye aur main aapko pick karunga 11.00 am ko aur hum Majid Bhai ke office jayenge , who aapko milne ke liye betaab hai.( Sir, you get refreshed up and I shall pick you up at 11 and we shall go to Majid bhai office , he is waiting to see you .) and Abdul left.<br />
<br />
Then at 11 they reached Majid Khan’s office. It was a big office  where there were many products displayed . ( he was distributer for many category of products). Vinod noticed that his company products were displayed prominently but what he didn’t fail to notice that they had also displayed his competitors products equally prominently ( or was it even more , he wondered).  They passed the office staff and he noticed that there were many female clerical staff and they were young .<br />
“Welcome Mr. Vinod ji, Swagat hai humare gareeb khaane mai ( Welcome Mr. Vinodji, welcome to my humble office )” declared Majid Khan with a flourish and his hands stretched and shook hands with Vinod. <br />
Majid Khan was a huge man 6 ft 2 maybe , dark and had a not so pleasant , bordering on sinister face , with broad shoulders and big forearms and biceps/ triceps and the one thing which stood out was the size of his palms  , they were huge and when he shook Vinod’s hands Vinods palm almost disappeared in the huge palms of Majid . He flashed a toothy grin which was even more sinister almost dismissive . <br />
“ Baithiye Vinod ji (Please Sit Vinod ji ) <br />
“Mujhe Mehraji ka message mila aur who chahte hai ki aap ek office yaha par karna hai , Sahi ? (I have received the message from Mr. Mehra and that you want to establish an office here, Right ?) <br />
Kuch bhi ho, hum toh hamesha hai aap ke seva main ( whatever the case, we are always there for your service ) continued Majid .<br />
Then they discussed th various business aspects and then they decided to start searching for office and house for Vinod and also about employing staff for the office . Vinod told Majid that they don’t have much time and the office have to be operational by 1st of the coming month. Majid assured Vinod that the deadline shall be taken care off.<br />
Then for the next few days they finalized the office premises and finalized all the formalities, it was easy as Majid was a builder too and had many links to the builder community so they got a nice office. Now it was time to go back to Pune and bring Swati to finalise their house<br />
Sir, Aap ka ghar ka kya ? Aap ke liye bhi ghar dekh lete hai ? asked Majid while they were having dinner <br />
Majid bhai , Dekhenge par meri wife ko hi select karni hai ghar , kyonki nahi toh who zaroor nuks nikalegi haha ( Majid bhai , have to look , but let that selection be made by my wife , else she would keep finding faults “ )Laughed away Vinod .<br />
“Ha Ha , Ha who toh bhabhiji ka haq hai, aap unse kahiye ki Majid  ekdum best ghar dilwoonga , jisse use koi complaint nahi hoga ( yes that is the right of Bhabhiji, please tell her that Majid would arrange to get the best house for her and she won’t have any complaints )”.<br />
Thank you Majid Bhai.<br />
Acha Vinod Ji. Aap Kuch lenge thoda beer , Whisky  ? pura bar hai humare pass ( Vinod , you would like to take  some Beer or Whisky , We have a full bar here ) asked Majid.<br />
Yes Zaroor . <br />
And thay started drinking and then ,<br />
Majid said “Chalo Harish ko bhi bulate hai .( lets call Harish too .) “Aap ko parichiye kara deta hoon( let me introduce him to you )”<br />
“ Majid Bhai , kaun hai yeh Harish , aapka koi staff hai kya ? ( Who is this Harish ? is he one of youe staff?) “ queries Vinod.<br />
“ Nahi Vinod , who tumhara competitor hai na Welford Ltd uska  Area Manager hai   ( No Vinod, he is the Area manager of your competitor Welford Ltd) . “ Who yahi Pass main rahta hai ( He stays nearby )” . “ “Acha ladka hai woh ( he is a nice fellow )”<br />
Vinod was confused but didn’t object and Majid called Harish and called him over .<br />
“ Abi aa raha hai woh (He is coming soon)” said Majid <br />
A man in his late twenties , almost of the same age of Vinod entered the room , as soon as he saw , his eyes shone as he said “ Vinod ….. ? what a surprise … “ . Vinod also got up and replied “ oh Harish ….. ? after long time , How come here ? <br />
Majid interjected “ Arre tum dono ek dusre ko jaante hai ? ( do you guys know each other ? ) <br />
Yes Majid bhai , replied Harish , “main isko Pune main se jaante hai , jab main teen saal pahele dusre co main kaam karta tha ( I know him from Pune days three years ago when  I was working for another company). Hum log hang out karte the kabhi kabhi, clubs main ( We used to hang out in clubs sometimes   )<br />
“Aur Majid bhai yeh bhi humari tarah thoda shaukeen hai ( and he is also a  bit colourful like us )” winked  Harish to Majid.<br />
And they recounted their escapades ( This is couple of years before Vinod married and he was enjoying his bachelor and he was dating Swati )and had a great laugh and Majid too chipped in .<br />
“ arre , tu usi maal se shadi kiya ya koi aur mila ? ( Did you get married to that same  bitch or got someone else?)”<br />
“ Wohi teri Bhabhi Hai ab , Harish ( yes she is now your Sister in Law).<br />
“ Sach bata doon …. Ekdum maal thi woh , Mujhe laga who tujhe tang degi . saala Nasseb wala kutta hai tu( Shall I tell you the truth… She was quite a sexy bitch , honestly I thought she would ditch you .. Lucky dog)”<br />
“ Abe saale Tune kab dekha usko ? ( Hey when did you see her ?) interjected Vinod .<br />
“ Arre yaad nahi ? Ek baar hum ek party main mile they when woh Mumbai se tumhe milne aaye the , tum ne intro karke diya tha ( arre you don’t remember ? Once in a party we had met  in a party when you had introduced her to me , when she had come to meet you from Mumbai )“ . <br />
Oh Hmmmm … Vinod mutters<br />
“ Anyways Abhi  toh yahi aa rahi hai , mil lenge Bhabhi ji ko ( Anyways she is coming here, shall meet once bhabhi  is here.)”  Blurted Harish barely able to hide his excitement , which was noted by the cunning Majid .<br />
<br />
Ding dong , “ I am back my swee-pie , Swati opened the door and she enveloped Vinod in a passionate embrace and gave lots of kisses on his face and culminated a deep french kiss on his lips and continued for almost 3 minutes . She missed him horribly and was very horny too , she was virtually rubbing her soft well filled body on his . <br />
They both dragged each other to the bed room and as usual when both are very horny Vinod makes Swati to do a bharatnatyam dance ( Sometimes a film dance too ) wearing only a thin see through cotton cloth with nothing underneath ( like made famous by the erstwhile Hindi actress Manadakini in the film Ram Teri Ganga Maili) . This was a routine they followed when either one or both becomes very horny as Swati knew this made Vinod very very hard and like a hubgry tiger he would jump on her . Then  made crazy love to each other . <br />
While having diner , Vinod says “ Swee-pie , we have to start for Kolhapur day after tomorrow , we may pack our day to day things and carry with us and you have to come as we need to finalise our house and Majid bhai our distributer there has promised us to find a great house. <br />
“hmmm Ok I shall pack tomorrow “ says Swati resignedly.<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile , Majid Khan and Harish was having a drink in the next day evening . They were very good friends and Majid was responsible to get him this job after her was sacked from his previous job as he coulnt perform as he was a lazy guy and had an extreme weakness for women a trait which was shared  by Majid himself, who was a womenizer par excellence. Harish used to try to seduce any woman he would see and fancy  and was very cunning . Majid was even worse he would try all the tricks to bed the women he has his eyes set . So both were literally made for each other and now as both knew each other they started hunting together and Harish literally acknowledges Majid as his guru and is willing to do anything for him.<br />
Majid recollecting the conversation they had with Vinod the earlier day asks Harish, “ Harish, Kal tu bol raha than a , who Vinod ke biwi bare mai , kaisi hai woh ? (Harish , yesterday you were saying you had seen Mr. Vinods wife , I am curious , how is she ? “)He asks with a wink,<br />
Harish took a deep breath and said “ Majid bhai , sach bataoon ? main use ek hi baar dekha hai , lekin main aisa auratokon nahi bhulta , kya maal thi wah , mujhe abhi bhi yaad hai , woh ek chiffon saari paheni thi aur us main ekdum pari lag rahi thi , ekdum makhan badan thi , muje abhi bhi yaad hai jab Vinod ne mujhe use intro kiya aur who mujhe dekhkar smile kiya , uski ankhen jo adh khuli adh band jaisi thi , jaise koi sexy south indian actress jaise, rang bhi gori aur badan  ka structure ekdum waisi hi , lambi lambi kale ghane baal kamar tak. lekin sab tarah se bhari this aur uski chaal , uffff yaar . ab kya bataye, lund khada kiya tha usne chand palon main hi ( Majid bhia , shall I tell you the truth ? I have seen her once , but I lnever forget such women, what a piece she was , I still remember , she had worn a chiffon sareeand she was looking like an angel , soft like butter, I still remember when Vinod introduced me and she had smiled to me , her eyes were half closed and half opened, like a south indian film actress  , very similar body ,  very filled, she had long black hair till her waist and her walk uffff yaar . the walk made me crazy and made my dick dancing within a few moments itself.”)<br />
<br />
“Hmmm Harish, Itna karari maal hai woh ? Saala tut oh itna tareef kisiki abh tak nahi kiya hai ( hmmm seems quite a mouthwatering woman, never heard you praise a woman that much). Said Majid curiously.<br />
“ Arre Majid bhai , tum dekho aur decide karo . laughs Harish .

		Update 2 .....<br />
<br />
The day arrives and they start the journey in their car early in the morning  and reach Kolhapur in the evening . Majid had booked their room in a nice hotel . They checked in and then rested a bit and then there was a call ..<br />
“ Hello Vinod ji, welcome back , safar main kuch dikkat toh nahi than a ? ( Hope you didn’t have any problems in the journey “). <br />
“  Abhi aaplok thak gaye honge , aaj ka khana mere yaha hai , aap mere ghar aayiye raat ko 7.30 baje , Abdul aayega gaadi lekar tumhe pickup karne ke liye ( now you must be tired, so todays dinner would be at my place and Abdul would come to pick you up.” )<br />
“ O Majid bhai , iski kya zaroorat thi ? ( O majid bhai , why this formality ? ) “. “ Ok Aa jaunga hum 7.30 baje, thank you bhai .” replied Vinod.<br />
<br />
Sharp  7.30pm , Vinod and Swati gets picked up by Abdul and they reach the bunglow of Majid Khan . I was a big bunglow with a huge intimidating gate, huge garden with well manicured lawns and lots of garden  plants etc . Abdul knocked and pushed open the main teak door and gestured thm to get in “ “Aayiye  Vinod bhai and Bhabhiji , aapka hamare gharib khane main swagat hai “ ( Welcome Vinod bha and bhabhiji, welcome to my humble abode )”  welcomed a beaming Majid bhai as he welcomed both with a Namaste , he was wearing an expensive silk green  kurta and tried his best to look good. His mouth was red due to consuming paan and his eyes had a reddish look ( may be due to his drinking habit) saying he came near the door to receive the young couple and he stood right on his track and his eyes were stuck to the voluptuous beauty  in front of him . Swati was wearing a red chiffon saree which was hugging her well filled figure nicely and a black sleeveless blouse  , she had put a nice matching red and black bindi and her large expressive eyes were prettily laced with kajal and she had put a not so bright lipstick and her ears were adorned with ruby earrings and she had proudly adorned a  mangalsutra . Over all she looked like a hot movie actress . <br />
She loved dressing up as she knows the effect it has on men and she secretly loves the feeling. Majid khan looked her beauty from head to toe and back to head and in his mind mentioned “ Mash,.' , kya maal hai (Mashalla h, What a piece!!) “ and kept staring numbly for a few moments .Suddenly he recovered to a  voice from behind <br />
 “Welcome Bhabhiji , Pahichana Mujhe? ( Welcome Bhabhi Remember me ?)“ <br />
It was Harish who came grinning to the door and put out his hands for Swati  and Swati squinted her eyes trying to remember , then suddenly remembered as Vinod had told that Harish was also in Kolhapur etc etc when he was discussing about Kolhapur visit .<br />
 “ O yes Harish, yes I remember you very well , you have changed a bit “  said Swati . <br />
Then Majid introduced them to his wife ( who was a middle aged women , appeared a bit uneducated , but was good to talk with and was interacting well with Swati.  <br />
Then they all sat down and started discussing about general things etc and all the time Majid’s eyes were slealthily on Swati , his eyes just couldnt get away from Swati , her body ( though he couldn’t see much , but he was trying to imagine hard) and Majid could feel a feeling of hardness developing  between his legs , the more he was looking at Swati. In the meanwhile , Harish was also sweating hard , but he was acting differently he was trying hard to impress Swati with his looks and the way he cracked jokes etc . ( He was a good looking guy with a good physique ).  <br />
“ Ari Mumtaz begum , Swati Madam ko apna ghar to dikhaiye ( hey Mumtaz begum , show Swati around the house )“ . All of the got up and Mumtaz let them to show around the house followed by Swati and the men . Majid was walking behind Swati and his eyes were enjoying the sight of Swati’s walk , her undulating walk , with her ample ass shaking and moving left and right , he was staring to see the breasts from sides but unfortunately Swati had it well covered with her pallu , hence Majid could only guess the size of it from outside.  He looked down at the manicured feet of Swati and admired and muttered to himself ,” kya sadol badan hai iska aur kitni khoobsoorati se apna pair ko rakha hai ( What a voluptuous figure she has and look how pretty her feet are )“ He had a thing towards women’s feet .  <br />
Suddenly , “ uuuui amaaaa “ Swati ahead of him slipped abruptly and was about to fall back onto Maijd, Majid responded quickly and held her by her arm . His lund got a huge shot of electricity as he held her by her arm which was nude as she was wearing sleeveless blouse , He could feel the extreme and for a soft ness of her arms and for a split moment she was leant on to him and for a micro second while he was stabilizing her back to her feet , her glorious behind globes touched his thighs and another streak of jolt hit him and that very brief touch registered in his mind permanently .<br />
Then they had dinner and Majid asked Swati , What kind of house she is looking and Swati replied that she is looking for a independent house , with 3 bedrooms etc  , with a bit of garden , if possible .<br />
 “ main toh pura mahel chahungi pur hmmm inka budget limited hoga na ( I would love to have palace , but hmmm he is got a budget)“ giggled Swati.<br />
“ Arre Madam, Hum  kis marz ki dawa hai  hain , Bahut acha ghar dhoondke dunga , yuhi builder nahi hoon main ( Arre Madam, why  are we for , shall get you a nice house , iam not builder for  no reason) “  replied Majid Laughingly ”.<br />
“ Shukriya Majidji“  (“Thank you Majidji “)Smiled Swati.<br />
“ Vinod bhai , Kal aap dono subah mere office main aana , main tum logon ko yahaka subse behetarin row houses , who be gated colony main dikhate hai , who mera hi project hai . ( Vinod bhai, tomorrow morning both of you come to my office and I shall show you the best  row houses that too in gated community . These are my project too)<br />
Then they returned back to hotel.<br />
“ Kaisa laga Majid bhai tumhe ( How did you find Majid bhai ? )” Asked Vinod .<br />
“ Such bataun ? Mujhe who Majid bilkun pasand nahi aaya , Kya gandi nazron se dekhta tha . Mujhe bahut awkward laga aur usko begum bhi mujhe sahi nahi laga , bahut chalu laga , taane marnewali lagi. ( let me tell you the truth, I didn’t like Majid , he was looking a sly and cunning and was looking at me crudely and his wife that begum , she also looked so cunning and had taunting eyes and tone all the time. Said Swati remembering the events . <br />
“ and Harish “ queried Vinod . “ Harish … you know na , I did’t like him from the first day , keeps looking at me and checking me out with that look  all the time and tryng to be funny … Replied Swati with contempt .<br />
Swati was like that , involuntarily had a superiority complex over others , she was very proud of her looks and dismissive of others , although she never used to behave outwardly  like that as she was very diplomatic.<br />
Back at Majid Residence …<br />
Majid Khan and Harish were sitting and having drinks,<br />
“ Kaisi lagi apni Swati Bhabhi ? ( how did you find our Swati Bhabhi ?) “ Asks Harish slyly well aware of the impact she had on Majid.<br />
“ ummmm mash,.', kya husn payi hai woh, jaan le gayi woh. Aaj tak itna aurat aur ladki dekhi aur bhoga bhi par paheli nazar main isne mera lund ekdum khada kar diya abe. ( what beauty she is , she made me crazy, have seen and enjoyed so many beautiful women and girls in my life , never has anyone made my dick so haaard  till now .) “ Saying he gave a slight rub to his dick.<br />
“ Yahi mera feeling bhi hai bhai “ usko dekhkar mera lund bhi neeche utarne ka naam nahi le raha hai , aapko toh malum hai meri shaadi kuch dino main , lekin yaar isko dekhkar meri  Shilpa toh paani peeti hai. ( That’s my feelings too bhai . After seeing her even my dick is getting crazy and you its my marriage next week but after seeing her upclose my Shilpa looks pedestrian ). Mutters Harish Wantonly and rubbing his dick openly through his trousers .<br />
“ Arre tujhe toh Gori Chiti Shilpa hai chodnekeliye shaadi ke baad, mera kya ? , Saali , Swati , Dimag kharab karke rakh diya ha i( Arre you have the fair bomb Shilpa to fuck after marriage , what about me ? )” sighed Majid .<br />
“ Harish, Maine mann bana liya , kisi bhi tarah se mujhe yeh saali Swati chahiye aur tu mujhe is main madad karega ( Harish , I ve made up my mind , I want this bitch Swati and you will help me in getting her “). Blurted out Majid Khan determinedly  .<br />
Harish Smiled wickedly and said “ aap toh guru hai aur aap ke liye kuch bhi (you are my guru and anything you say)” , <br />
Harish was totally consumed by the married housewife and  thinking whether Majid gets Swati or not , I need this bitch badly but its better they both join hands to hunt this bitch.<br />
“ Hum Kuch sochte hai Majid bhai ( lets think of some thing ) said Harish reassuring Majid.

		Harish was totally under obligation of Majid, He had lost his job and he was struggling for money had no means of earning to support his family of 3 , his mother and  a younger sister Deepa , who was  18 years and who was studying in college and to due to the frustration he  got into drugs and had become an addict , to finance the same he was peddling drugs .In the meanwhile Harish  fell in the infighting and rivalry of two drugs gang and somehow got involved in a murder of a rival gang member and was caught and the entire gang was under investigation and was in line for  long stint in jail and even if Harish would have come out after tenure in jail , the rival gang would have bumped him off in revenge  .Then helpless Deepa approached her child hood friend’s father and he referred her to Majid Khan and mentioned he was the only person  who could save her family . Deepa approached Majid  and pleaded &amp; begged him for the life of Harish as she knew Majid was the only man in her knowledge who could help them .Deepa was a very fair girl with spotless milky complexion with skin as soft as butter ,  with long hair and had very shapely body with nice curves all over her body .  Majid ,  eying Deepa and his youthful figure , got blown away and decided that he need to get this  delicious fish and thus  agreed to help her , under the one condition that both she and Harish would have to be loyal to him and Harish should work for him . Majid used all contacts and influence in his political and security officer circles and got him out of the case and he also made deal with the rival gang leader , Gulabrao and got them to accept Harish’s apology . Since then Majid had managed to make  Harish totally under his control and both he and Deepa too are unflinchingly loyal to him  ( although Harish technically works for another company as their Area Manager ).Deepa goes to the college with Majid cunning eyes totally on her as he waits for her to grow into a fine piece of woman .<br />
<br />
“Majid Bhai , Aap ne mujhe jo row house diya hai na rent pe , aap ke  Greens Project main , waha mere row house ke bagal wale row house khali hai , kyon na hum Vinod ko who ghar rent pe de de?Bahut MAza aayega .( Majid bhai, the row house you have given me on rent , in your Greens Project, the row house next to me is also vacant . Why don’t you give it to Vinod and Bhabhi. It will so much fun )”.<br />
“hmmmm Who toh hai . Lekin us main mujhe kya milega , tu toh line marega par mera kya hoga ? ( hmmmm I see , Buts whats in it for me ? you will encircle her but what about me “). Sighed Majid.<br />
“ Lekin Harish tumhe toh Row house diya hai uske badale ka wada toh nahi hoola na ? ( harish , But I hope you have not forgotten the promise which you have made in return for the row house .)”.Reminded Majid with a sly look .<br />
Once Harish was saved and given a job by Majid , Harish was after Majid to allow him to get married . As nobody in the town wanted to give him their daughter , Then Majid khan’s eye once fell on to the daughter of one of his accountant and incidently he was from the same community of Harish and he started to persue it with Mr. Joshi , the father of the girl , Shilpa . Mr. Joshi didn’t want to give her daughter to Harish as he had a bad reputation , but eventually fell for the coercion of Majid Khan . <br />
The condition was in Majid’s Words “ Dekh Harish , tu mera kareebi hai aur mujhe pata hai tu mere liye kuch bhi kar sakta hai , kuch bhi aur main tujhse aaj tak kuch bhi nahi maanga hai ( look Harish , You are very close to me and I know you will anything for me , absolutely anything and I have never asked you anything yet. )” . <br />
“Majid bhai aap puchiye toh sahi aap ke liye kuch is duniya main main karunga ( Majid Bhai , you can ask me anything in this world)”  said an emotional Harish.<br />
“ Dekh , Harish , Maine Bahut ladkkiyo ko aur aurato ko bhoga hai , bahut maje kiye , lekin maine aaj tak ek suhag raat live nahi dekhi hai , Meri icha hai ki jab tu Shilpa ke saath Suhagraat karega who nazara main “live” dekhega  aur tera honeymoon bhi . ( Look Harish , I have laid many girls and women , had lots of fun , but till today I have not seen a wedding first night live and I want to see your wedding first night” live “ and also your honeymoon . )”.<br />
Harish was shocked “ yeh kya kah diya Majid bhai aap ne !( what have you asked Majid bhai !) Main yeh kaisa kar sakta ( How can I do it )?”<br />
He was stunned . Cunning Majid had Left him pondering , giving time to recover and enable him to do what eventually he ll have to do. <br />
Next day he  agreed to the condition as he realized that saying no to Majid is inviting trouble for his family and infact Majid could cancel the marriage too . He thought for this sacrifice he would get much more benefits .<br />
Back to present , Harish was thinking his biggest compensation would be if he gets to bang the hot housewife Swati with the blessings of Majid Khan.
